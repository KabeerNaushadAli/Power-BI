# POWER BI : Maven Market Sales Insights Dashboard

## Project Overview

The Maven Market Sales Insights Dashboard is a hands-on project from the Udemy course "Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence" by Maven Analytics. The project challenges students to apply their learning by building a comprehensive dashboard from scratch. This dashboard provides a detailed overview of Maven Market's sales performance, focusing on key metrics such as revenue, profits, top products, and customer trends across different regions. The aim is to help the sales team track monthly growth, identify trends, and make informed business decisions.

## Data Sources
The data used in this project is provided by the course and includes:

- Regions: Geographical information about the sales territories.
- Customer Information: Customer demographics, membership types, and priority levels.
- Product Information: Details on product categories and individual items.
- Stores: Data on various store locations.
- Transactions Data: Sales records from December 1996 to December 1998.
- Return Data: Information about returned products.

## Key Metrics and Visualizations
The dashboard tracks various key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizes them to provide actionable insights:

- Metrics Tracked: Total revenue, profits, number of transactions, profit margins, and return rates.
- Comparison of Current vs. Previous Month: KPIs are color-coded (green for positive changes, red for negative), making it easy to track month-over-month performance.
- Line Charts: Show revenue trends over time, helping to identify seasonal patterns or shifts in sales.
- Bar Charts: Compare sales performance across different regions, allowing the team to focus on high-performing areas.
- Top 10 Products Table: Lists the top products by transactions, profits, profit margin, and return rate, enabling the sales team to prioritize their efforts.
- Product Details: An interactive section where users can explore individual products and adjust prices to see the impact on profit margins.
- Customer Details: Highlights the top customers based on revenue, transactions, and quantity purchased, along with their membership type and priority status. Line charts show the number of customers over time, providing insights into customer acquisition trends.

## Challenges and Solutions
KPI Calculation Issue: Initially, the KPI for the current month vs. the previous month was incorrect. The problem was resolved by establishing the correct data model relationship between the transaction data and the calendar table, ensuring accurate calculations.

Dashboard Design: As a first-time creator, designing the dashboard was challenging. I experimented with different color palettes and reviewed various examples online to improve the UI/UX. Ultimately, I learned that a visually appealing dashboard is crucial for user engagement, regardless of the quality of the data insights.

## Impact/Recommendations
This dashboard enables the sales team to identify high-profit-margin products as well as those with a high return rate. I recommend conducting R&D on products with high return rates to address underlying issues and reduce return rates, thus improving profitability.

## Tools & Techniques Used
The dashboard was built using Power BI, with data cleaning performed in Power Query and DAX calculations used for custom metrics.
